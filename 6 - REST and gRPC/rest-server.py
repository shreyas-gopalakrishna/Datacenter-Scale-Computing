##
## Sample Flask REST server implementing two methods
##
## Endpoint /api/image is a POST method taking a body containing an image
## It returns a JSON document providing the 'width' and 'height' of the
## image that was provided. The Python Image Library (pillow) is used to
## proce#ss the image
##
## Endpoint /api/add/X/Y is a post or get method returns a JSON body
## containing the sum of 'X' and 'Y'. The body of the request is ignored
